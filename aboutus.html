                        <p>Suit Up, a not-for-profit organization, custom tailors donated business attire to not only affirm the dignity of all men seeking professional opportunities, but to also inspire a community of giving.</p>

                        <h2 class="center">Our Story</h2>

                        <p>The founders of Suit Up all met and became close friends while teaching at Regis Jesuit High School. As a result, we believe our value in this world to be determined by how we love, inspire, educate, and serve the people in our communities.</p>
                        <p>One of the three founders became a custom clothier in Denver. When he noticed the amount of unused clothing in his clients’ closets, he realized there was an opportunity to start a non-profit. And Suit Up was born.</p>

                        <h2 class="center">Our Approach</h2>

                        <p>To make our mission simple and effective, we will almost always assume good will on behalf of each person with which we work; however, in order to receive a custom tailored suit, we will ask each candidate two questions:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Can you do any one thing to help improve your community?</b></li>
                            <li><b>Are you willing to try and do that?</b></li>
                        </ol>
                        </div>

                        <h2 class="center">The Process</h2>

                        <p>With a goal of wanting to provide a positive impulse to our community, Suit Up accepts new and gently used business attire for men of all ages. The clothing will be used for interviews, employment, or any other sound need.</p>
                        <p>Our application process seeks to place donated business attire in the hands of deserving individuals who also want to provide a positive impulse into his community. Our application specifically requires that an applicant undertake one random act of kindness for another individual. This act will serve to qualify an individual for donation. It is our hope that our donations will spark further selfless giving.</p>

                        <p>Our partnerships with local high schools and community organizations will provide several avenues for donation. Any donation: suits, coats, pants, belts, shoes, shirts, ties, etc. are greatly appreciated. It is our pleasure to travel to your location to pick up the donation at your convenience for qualifying donations. Simply clean out your closet and contact us!</p>
                        <p>Upon an applicant being selected to receive a donation, we will have the suit custom fitted to the individual, have his name embroidered on the inside pocket, and if able, provide coordinating shirts, ties, belts, and shoes.</p>
